# Ekko Themes

## Install

`npm install`

## Running

`npm run design`

You'll then need to run the project as a website. Install Live Server with `npm install live-server -g` and then run `live-server` inside the root of the project. This should open up a browser window with the site running. Edit the source files in the chosen Theme folder, and it should reload.
