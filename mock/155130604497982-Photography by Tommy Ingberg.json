I was also named one of two \"Country Picks\" for Sweden. I am a strong believer that you can't compete in art, but this recognition is special to me personally since these pictures are some of my last efforts in that body of work and also made during a turbulent time in my life when I had a hard time focusing on my art, and also did not feel very confident in my work and where it was heading. I've since then started a new journey with my new body of work that I am very excited about, and this award feels like a great end to the Reality Rearranged / Solitaire series.\n\nYou can view the winning entry here: http://www.photoawards.com/winner/zoom.php?eid=8-114751-16\n\nThe 2016 International Photography Awards received nearly 15,000 submissions from 103 countries across the globe. IPA is a sister-effort of the Lucie Foundation.. The Foundation's mission is to honor master photographers, to discover new and emerging talent and to promote the appreciation of photography. Since 2003, IPA has had the privilege and opportunity to acknowledge and recognize contemporary photographers' accomplishments in this specialized and highly visible competition.","created_time":"2016-10-06T17:47:23+0000","id":"155130604497982_1296934120317619"}],"picture":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/11159459_985415751469459_8223758932201082557_n.jpg?oh=bd379ea9f9220605aa5606c4de57018e&oe=590DFD4C"},"events":[],"call_to_actions":[{"web_url":"http://www.ingberg.com/default.aspx?Page=shop_prints_online&PID=64","type":"SHOP_NOW","status":"ACTIVE","web_destination_type":"WEBSITE","id":"1140656212612078"}],"screennames":[{"service_name":"Twitter","value":"twitter.com/tommy_ingberg"}]}
