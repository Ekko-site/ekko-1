It's not hard to access or remote by any means but what makes it unique was the military bunkers built into the walls of the 1 mile long canyon. Secret passageways and underground storehouses left behind from WWII and relatively unopened since. I felt like a kid on set in a Indiana Jones film.","created_time":"2017-01-23T19:33:56+0000","id":"157927360906982_1423929757640063"},{"full_picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/16115008_1422887851077587_5214611476004130971_n.jpg?oh=5f6d64752968fdb543e54487a6d0b167&oe=590CD6BE","object_id":"1422887851077587","message":"Last year when I visited the well known Horseshoe bend for the first time I was a bit worried it was going to be a cluster of people trying to get the same shot at perfect light.... and to be honest it kinda was. What was shocking though was that 100 ft in either direction it was almost empty. Past that you were well beyond the tourist trail...far from all the noise & dust. It started to feel Wild again. \n.\nI've seen this same thing in many popular places for photography across the globe. \nWe're creatures of habit and often judge how well an image is by how it stacks up to others. We tend to sacrifice a meaningful experience by ourselves in nature in order to nail that perfect shot even if it means we're surrounded by chaos.","created_time":"2017-01-22T23:33:20+0000","id":"157927360906982_1422887851077587"},{"full_picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/16114993_1422089154490790_3278255499773962502_n.jpg?oh=5e35c7e91521e761a508964a86905c0b&oe=590C6F64","object_id":"1422089154490790","message":"Simply put.
